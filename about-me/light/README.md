As of now: nothing special. Word of wisdom to any lost soul who stumbles upon this: until this message is gone, I would advise you not to risk burning your eyes looking at the messy combobulation of code which is this repo.

*Note to future: will be open-sourced personal website/blog built around Laravel 4.x and leveraging fancy things such as AngularJS and whatever other exciting things have my attention at the moment.

*Note to future future self: Will house (hopefully) helpful tutorials for souls such as myself on the journey for wisdom. Wisdom of developing for the web.

Again, disregard both the code and this message. 

Goodbye.
